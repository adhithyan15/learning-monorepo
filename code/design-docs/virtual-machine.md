# Building Virtual Machine
I want to start building a virtual machine that is capable of executing instructions. But I will take a very incremental approach to it. 

## Bit
At the lowest level, every instruction has to turn into ones and zeros because that's what the hardware understands. 

* ON is interepreted as binary digit 1
* OFF is interpreted as binary digit 0
