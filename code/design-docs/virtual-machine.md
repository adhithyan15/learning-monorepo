# Building Virtual Machine
I want to start building a virtual machine that is capable of executing instructions. But I will take a very incremental approach to it. 

## Program
A program is a collection of instructions and data. The virtual machine will take in programs and execute them.The program will expose a way for the virtual machine to fetch instructions. 

## Bit
At the lowest level, every instruction has to turn into ones and zeros because that's what the hardware understands. 

* ON is interepreted as binary digit 1
* OFF is interpreted as binary digit 0
