# Perl Programming Language
Perl is a general purpose, high level and interpreted programming language. It was designed by Larry Wall in 1987. It specifically excels in text processing due to regex capabilities. This document will be a collection of my notes on the Perl language. You can find corresponding code in the code/programs or code/libraries folder. 

## Built In Functions

### print
`print` function can be used to print text on the screen. Here is a simple "Hello World" program

```perl
print "Hello World\n";
```

Semicolons are generally required in Perl.
