# Java
Java is a high level, object-oriented and general purpose programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. One of its biggest selling features is the write once, run everywhere feature. Java compiles the code into an intermediate representation and uses a virtual machine that can run on any supported platform to run it. This was a great improvement from C/C++ which had to be compiled for each platform separately. It is memory safe by default as well because it uses a garbage collector. Java also a huge standard library for all sorts of purposes including building cross platform user interfaces. The biggest con of Java is the verbosity of code.
