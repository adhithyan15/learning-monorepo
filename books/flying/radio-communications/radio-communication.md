# Radio Communications
Mastering radio communication is crucial in becoming a pilot. Here is all the information that you need to know to master radio work. 

## Air Traffic Control
Air Traffic Control's job is to provide safe, orderly and expeditious flow of traffic. They also provide separation for IFR traffic. Air traffic control also provides services in case of emergencies. Multiple controllers might be working together. ATIS is also broadcasted by the tower. One level above air traffic control is the ARTCC (Air Route Traffic Control Centers) or more commonly known as the "center". They help you while between different airports. They control a certain part of area. They are radar equipped and you will be given a transponder code so that they can easily identify you. There is also something called Flight Service Stations also known as "radio". They provide a ton of services. You can think of them as the customer service for air traffic control. 

## Ground Station Call Signs
* If there is no tower, you will have to use Unicom. Let's say you are in Seattle, you will be calling into Unicom with "Seattle Unicom". 
* If you are calling into a flight service station, you will refer to them by "Seattle Radio"
* If you are calling into an air traffic control tower, you will refer to them by "Seattle Tower"
* If you need to get a IFR clearance delivery, you will refer to them by "Seattle Clearance Delivery"
* If you need to talk to ground, you will refer to them by "Seattle Ground"
* If you need to talk to approach, you will refer to them by "Seattle Approach"
* If you need to talk to departure, you will refer to them by "Seattle Departure"
* If you need to talk to ARTCC, you will refer to them by "Seattle Center"
