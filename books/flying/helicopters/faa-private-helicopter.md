# FAA Private Helicopter Knowledge Test

## What makes helicopters fly?
* The way helicopters fly is almost miraculous
* Four forces acting on the helicopter - lift, weight, thrust and drag. These act on the airplane during unaccelerated flight. 
* Lift and thrust are produced by the rotor system. Lift is achieved by spinning motion of the rotor and specially shaped blades. Thrust is produced by tilting the rotors. 
* Helicopter rotor blades are airfoils. So the helicopter has rotating wings. The lift is produced according Bernoulli's principle.
* Chord line is an imaginary line between the leading and trailing edge of the wing.
* Angle of Attack is the angle between the chord line and the relative wind. 
* The amount of lift produced is relative to the angle of attack and speed of the relative wind.
* There is a critical angle of attack after which the wing produces no lift. 
* There is a red line on airspeed indicator. It indicates the never exceed speed. 
* The angle of attack for a propeller is defined as the angle between the propeller chord line and relative wind. 
* Helicopters are bound to torque naturally in a direction opposite to the spin of the rotor. Anti Torque rotor is a rotor that you find in the back of the helicopter. The pilot controls this using pedals and it counteracts the torque. 
* There are many different types of helicopter rotor systems. The first one is a two blade rotor system called semi-rigid rotor system. They are connected to each other using something called a tetering hinge. If one goes up another comes down. They are 180 degrees out of phase with each other. The blades also feather where their pitch changes. There are also three and five bladed rotor systems. These blades are not out of phase with each other. Instead, their rotor system would allow the blades to move in three dimensions independently. These rotor systems have a feathering hinge. They also have a flap hinge called the lead/lag hinge to allow for blades to flap around. 
* Coning - Coning is a phenomenon that happens when the blades lift upwards due to a combination of lift and centrifugal force. Coning also forces the blades to speed up due to coriolis effect. The lead lag hinge allows for blades to speed up and slow down to compensate for the coriolis effect.
* Unlike a fixed wing aircraft, the relative wind on each of the blades in the helicopter is different. When one blade experiences a head wind, another one might experience a tail wind. So, this results in unequal airspeeds between the blades, unequal angles of attack and equal lift moment. As the helicopter travels faster and faster, the helicopter experiences unequal lift on each side. This is called dissymmetry of lift. The way to compensate for this is by changing the angle of attack on the tail wind side of the helicopter. But if you go beyond the critical angle of attack, you will stall the tail wind blade in a phenomenon called retreating blade stall. You will notice that the blade has stalled because the plane will pitch up. 
* Here are some common factors for a retreating blade stall - high airspeed, high density altitude (high altitudes requires higher angles of attack as the air is thinner), low motor RPM (also requires higher angles of attack to maintain lift), turbulence, steep or abrupt turns and high gross weight.
* Maximum speed of the helicopter is determined by retreating blade stall speed. This is marked as the VNE on the speedometer.
