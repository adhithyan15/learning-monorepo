# FAA Private Helicopter Knowledge Test

## What makes helicopters fly?
* The way helicopters fly is almost miraculous
* Four forces acting on the helicopter - lift, weight, thrust and drag. These act on the airplane during unaccelerated flight. 
* Lift and thrust are produced by the rotor system. Lift is achieved by spinning motion of the rotor and specially shaped blades. Thrust is produced by tilting the rotors. 
* Helicopter rotor blades are airfoils. So the helicopter has rotating wings. The lift is produced according Bernoulli's principle.
* Chord line is an imaginary line between the leading and trailing edge of the wing.
* Angle of Attack is the angle between the chord line and the relative wind. 
* The amount of lift produced is relative to the angle of attack and speed of the relative wind.
* There is a critical angle of attack after which the wing produces no lift. 
* There is a red line on airspeed indicator. It indicates the never exceed speed. 
* The angle of attack for a propeller is defined as the angle between the propeller chord line and relative wind.
