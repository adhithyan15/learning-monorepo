# FAA Private Helicopter Knowledge Test

## What makes helicopters fly?
* The way helicopters fly is almost miraculous
* Four forces acting on the helicopter - lift, weight, thrust and drag. These act on the airplane during unaccelerated flight. 
* Lift and thrust are produced by the rotor system. Lift is achieved by spinning motion of the rotor and specially shaped blades. Thrust is produced by tilting the rotors. 
* Helicopter rotor blades are airfoils. So the helicopter has rotating wings. The lift is produced according Bernoulli's principle.
* Chord line is an imaginary line between the leading and trailing edge of the wing.
* Angle of Attack is the angle between the chord line and the relative wind. 
* The amount of lift produced is relative to the angle of attack and speed of the relative wind.
* There is a critical angle of attack after which the wing produces no lift. 
* There is a red line on airspeed indicator. It indicates the never exceed speed. 
* The angle of attack for a propeller is defined as the angle between the propeller chord line and relative wind. 
* Helicopters are bound to torque naturally in a direction opposite to the spin of the rotor. Anti Torque rotor is a rotor that you find in the back of the helicopter. The pilot controls this using pedals and it counteracts the torque. 
* There are many different types of helicopter rotor systems. The first one is a two blade rotor system called semi-rigid rotor system. They are connected to each other using something called a tetering hinge. If one goes up another comes down. They are 180 degrees out of phase with each other. The blades also feather where their pitch changes. There are also three and five bladed rotor systems. These blades are not out of phase with each other. Instead, their rotor system would allow the blades to move in three dimensions independently. These rotor systems have a feathering hinge. They also have a flap hinge called the lead/lag hinge to allow for blades to flap around. 
* Coning - Coning is a phenomenon that happens when the blades lift upwards due to a combination of lift and centrifugal force. Coning also forces the blades to speed up due to coriolis effect. The lead lag hinge allows for blades to speed up and slow down to compensate for the coriolis effect.
* Unlike a fixed wing aircraft, the relative wind on each of the blades in the helicopter is different. When one blade experiences a head wind, another one might experience a tail wind. So, this results in unequal airspeeds between the blades, unequal angles of attack and equal lift moment. As the helicopter travels faster and faster, the helicopter experiences unequal lift on each side. This is called dissymmetry of lift. The way to compensate for this is by changing the angle of attack on the tail wind side of the helicopter. But if you go beyond the critical angle of attack, you will stall the tail wind blade in a phenomenon called retreating blade stall. You will notice that the blade has stalled because the plane will pitch up. 
* Here are some common factors for a retreating blade stall - high airspeed, high density altitude (high altitudes requires higher angles of attack as the air is thinner), low motor RPM (also requires higher angles of attack to maintain lift), turbulence, steep or abrupt turns and high gross weight.
* Maximum speed of the helicopter is determined by retreating blade stall speed. This is marked as the VNE on the speedometer. 
* It takes a lot of power to make a helicopter hover. But once you have started moving, the more air starts to go over the blades and the helicopter performs better. This is known as translational lift. It occurs in horizontal flight. Translational lift is a result of airspeed and not ground speed. 
* Ground Effect - For a given angle of attack, ground effect increases the lift produces. This is good for helicopters but very bad for fixed wing airplanes as it will cause the plane to float. 
* Translating tendency - It is the tendency of the helicopter to move sideways (usually to the right) as it attempts to hover. This is because the downwash from the rotor interacts with the fuselage causing the helicopter to move sideways. The tail rotor also contributes slightly to the translating tendency. The closer you are to the ground, the more pronounced this tendency is. Higher RPMs while hovering also produce a similar effect. Weight and balance might also contribute to this as well. Some helicopters have their rotor mast rigged to the left side to counteract this. 

## Helicopter Controls
Helicopters have three main control surfaces

### Collective
Collective is the level found on the left hand side of the pilot. Raising it increases the pitch of the rotor blades which in turn generates more lift allowing the helicopter to climb. Lowering it reduces lift, causing the helicopter to descend.

### Cyclic
Cyclic is the stick you will see in front of the pilot. It looks like joystick. Moving it tilts the main rotor disc. This controls the movement of the helicopter in all directions. 

### Anti Torque Pedals
These are usually at the pilot's feet. They control the tail rotor's pitch and there by controlling the thrust. It counteract the torque of the main rotor and allows the helicopter to yaw. 

## Helicopter Operations
### RPM (Rotations Per Minute)
RPM of the Helicopter engine is like the heartbeat in a human being. It is absolutely critical to the operation of the helicopter. It directly affects lift, control and overall safety. Here is how engine RPM affects helicopters
* Lift - In order to produce lift, you will need airflow over the blades. The higher the RPM of the blade, the more air is flowing over it. So, higher RPM produces more lift. Low RPM is a serious problem because blades might not able to generate lift. 
* Blade Pitch - Most helicopters have the collective control linked with engine RPM and blade pitch. Higher pitch at a given RPM produces more lift. But remember that blades can stall after a critical angle of attack. 
* Power - Engines are rated to produce a certain amount of RPM. So, we should always be aware of that. 
* Rotor Disc Stability - Consistent RPM is essential for maintaining a stable rotor disc. Fluctuations in RPM can produce vibrations, control issues and stalls. 
* Control Response - Flight controls are only as effective as the amount of air flowing over them. So, at higher RPMs, the helicopter responds to flight controls better. At lower RPMs, the flight controls might be sluggish. 
* Autorotation - If an engine was to fail in the middle of flight, helicopter enters what is known as an autorotation. Maintaining RPM in this case is crucial because it will allow the helicopter to descend safely. 
* Hovering - A stable and appropriate RPM is essential for precise hovering. Deviations from correct RPM can cause stability issues or drifting. 
* Manifold Pressure - It is super critical to observe the manifold pressure in the engine to figure out if the engine is performing well or not. High manifold pressure, the engine is performing well. Low manifold pressure, the engine is suffocating for air. So, open up the throttle to let more air in. 

### Gyroscopic Effects
A helicopter's rotor can be viewed as massive spinning gyroscope. When a force is applied to a spinning gyroscope, the resulting effect from the force doesn't happen at the point of application. Instead, it applies 90 degrees later in the direction of rotation. The practical implication of this effect is that helicopters don't immediately respond to controls. Instead, the pilot must 

### Common Guidance
* You will use collective pitch to start, taxi and stop. 
* You will use cyclic pitch to maintain ground track and drift during crosswind.
* If you have low RPM and low manifold pressure, this is usually the case where not enough air is entering the engine. So, you will have to open up the throttle to fix the issue. 
* If you have low RPM but high manifold pressure, that means a lot of air is entering the engine. The engine is putting out a lot of power. You can lower the collective to reduce some of the pitch angle. 
* If you have high RPM and high manifold pressure, that means a lot of air is entering and the engine is producing a lot of power. You can lower the throttle and reduce the air flow. 
* If you have high RPM and low manifold pressure, this means something might be wrong with the engine. So, you have to compensate with the collective by raising it. 

### Hover
Hovering is one of the most difficult operations to master in flying a helicopter. It requires constant adjustment on all the different flight control surfaces. Any wind can also make it very difficult to hover. Here are some very high level guidance on hovering

* Collective - Raising the collective increases lift while lovering it reduces lift. Hovering is also made difficult due to ground effect. You need to find a point where the weight of the helicopter matches the lift produced for hovering to be possible. 
* Cyclic - Helicopters have a tendenancy to drift rightwards in a hover. So, you will need to constantly adjust the cyclic to maintain a constant hover. Left hovering turn will require more power because of this situation. 
* Anti-Torque Pedals - Use the pedals to keep the aircraft pointing in the right direction.  
* Hovering above ground effect requires more power.
* Hot weather also causes issues. Hot air is less dense than cold air. So, the blades cannot produce as much lift. So, if you are doing a hot weather take off, accelerate slowly. 
* A running take off might be better if you cannot do a sustained hover. Either the altitude or gross weight makes it difficult to hover.
