# FAA Trust Certification
This certification allows anyone to operate unmanned aircraft under the Exception for Limited Recreational Operations of Unmanned Aircraft (49 USC 44809). The course is designed to inform you how you can safely operate drones and keep the airspace safe for everyone. 

## Requirements
* You should be flying for recreational purposes only
* Follow the safety guidelines of a community based organization (CBO)
* Keep your drone in your visual line of sight
* Always give way and never interfere with manned aircraft
* Get airspace authorization before flying in controlled airspace
* Do not fly higher than 400 ft above the ground in uncontrolled airspacec
* Pass an aeronautical knowledge and safety test
* Register and mark your drone and comply with remote ID.  

## Airspace
* Aircraft operations are limited to 400 ft above ground level in uncontrolled airspace and limited to UAS Facility Map altitudes in controlled airspace. 
* You are also required to follow any additional airspace restrictions as they are imposed. 
* Unauthorized flying in restricted airspace is a federal crime. 
* FAA has developed an app called FAA B4UFly. It provides accurate airspace information. FAA has also worked with industry to provide a solution called LAANC (pronounced Lance) that allows for requesting clearance to fly in controlled airspaces. 
* B4UFLY app provides a clear status indicator that tells you where you can fly. It also contains information about controlled airspaces, critical infrastructure, airports, national parks, military training routes and TFRs. It also allows you to move to different locations by dropping pins to see if it is safe to fly there. It also contains the latest regulartory information as well. 
* Do not directly contact ATC for clearance. Instead go through one of the LAANC providers or through FAA Drone Zone. FAA will alert ATC that there are drones in the area. 
* UAS Facility Maps provide maximum altitudes that aircraft can fly in controlled airspaces. It doesn't pre-authorize them for that altitude as authorizations are adjudicated on a case by case basis. 
* LAANC doesn't cover all the controlled airspace. So, you might have to use FAA Drone Zone to request areas not covered by LAANC. 

## Pre-Flight
* It is the pilot's responsibility to make sure that the drone is in a good condition to fly. 
* Do not fly damaged aircraft
* Do not fly aircraft at very high altitudes (beyond visual line of sight) or in areas where it might be hazardous. Always pay attention to wind and the automated functions in your aircraft. 
* Always check the weather bfore you fly
* Think about emergencies like high wings, poor visibility, turbulence, signal interference or loss of power. In certain cases, ice can form on your aircraft and make it fly in unexpected ways. Cloud cover and sunlight might make it harder to keep visual line of sight. Always look around for obstacles like trees, power lines, buildings and people. Other aircraft might appear out of no where. Focus on controlling the flight and avoid any distractions. Make sure that to plan a flight path that is going to keep your aircraft safe and clear of obstacles. 
* Make sure you as a pilot is physically and mentally ready to fly. You cannot be under the influence of any drugs (legal or illegal) or alcohol. Also factor in things like stress, fatigue and dehydration and how they might affect your flying abilities. 
* Check all the parts of the aircraft - propellers/rotors, blades, landing gear and others for damages or wear and tear. Replace any damaged parts before flying. Check your batteries for damage as they can cause fires. Do not fly with low battery power. Make sure that the control station has the latest software updates, good command and control strength and GPS coverage.  

## Line of Sight
* For flying under Section 49 USC 44809, you have to adhere to the rules proposed by a FAA approved community based organization. 
* You must keep your aircraft within your clear visual line of sight without the use of binoculars, cameras or other devices. If you use FPV, you will need add a visual observor to keep track of your aircraft during flight. Keeping your aircraft within the visual line of sight allows you to avoid ground obstacles, bystanders and manned aircraft. 
* Manned aircraft pilots cannot easily see your drone. That is why it is the responsibility of the UAS pilot to see and avoid manned aircraft. You always must give way to manned aircraft and cannot interfere in their operations. 

## Know Your Aircraft
* You should get to know your aircraft's maximum altitude, weight and flight distance. You should also know what automated features that the aircraft has and how to use them. The battery duration, signal range, ways of checking battery strength and signal strength before and during the flight. 
* Never fly your aircraft beyond the signal strength as it is the most common accident. You can also lose signal from interference or a weak connection. If you lose signal, you may lose control of the aircraft. Plan for what happens in the case of a loss of a signal. 
* The person flying the aircraft is responsible even if the aircraft is running automatically. Do not rely on geofencing or other features that rely on GPS. Learn how to take manual control of the aircraft. Some automated features might actually be troublesome like return to home, autoland or follow me. These might run into obstacles or people. 
* Always practice in areas with very few obstacles and no people nearby. Practice, practice and practice. Flying an unmanned aircraft is a skill and has to be developed and maintained. 
* Remote ID is like a license plate for your unmanned aircraft. It is required unless and until you are flying inside a FRIA. If your aircraft is less than 250 grams, it has no registration requirement and there by no remote ID requirement. 
* Any aircraft over the weight of 250 grams and flown for recreational purposes must be registered. 
* Law enforcement can ask for proof of aircraft registration and the completion of this course. The recreational flyers should also be able to explain which CBO's safety guidelines they follow.
