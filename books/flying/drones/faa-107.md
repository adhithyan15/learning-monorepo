* No endorsement required to take the exam
* 60 questions
* 2 hours to finish the exam
* 70% correct to pass
* 80% should be the goal because there are several trick questions. 
* FAA exams are on paper format
* You need to bring government ID and passport (if you are not a US citizen)

* Bring a ruler

### What topics are on the exam?
* Regulations 15-25%
* Airspace - 15-25%
* Weather - 11-16%
* Loading and Performance - 7- 11%
* Operations - 35 - 45%

## Loading & Performance
Drones can be fixed wing or quadcopters. FAA doesn't distinguish between the two. 

## RPIC Responsibilities
* Pilot in command is responsible to verify that the aircraft is loaded **prior to flight**.
* Loading is determined by the weight and balance of the aircraft. If proper weight and balance are not achieved, the flight be underpowered or unstable. 
* Manufacturer's specify the weight and balance requirements. Your responsibility as an rPIC is to make sure you comply with those specifications. These are usually specified in the Pilot's Operating Handbook or uAS flight manual (more common in small quadcopters)

## Axis of Rotation
* Roll - Controlled by ailerons - Turning left and right
* Pitch - Controlled by elevators - Climing up and down
* Yaw - Controlled by rudder

Quadcopter specific information
* Roll - Left or right on the controller left of joy stick. You can also control the pitch of the roll by using the up or down part left of joy stick. 
* Yaw - Left or right on the controller right of joy stick
* Elevator - Up or down on the controller right of joy stick

## Forces of Flight
* Lift - Upward force on the wing
* Weight - Downward force on the wing. Always opposite to lift. 
* Thrust - Forward force often produced by the engine
* Drag - Opposite of thrust

Rotorcraft also has four forces

### Lift
* Motors produce lift by rotorcraft
* On fixed wing aircraft, the lift is produced by the wing
* Lift can be visualized as being applied to a point known as the center of pressure or center of lift. (CP or CL is used in diagrams)
* Lift is always against the weight
* In straight and level flight, lift and weight are equal.
* Relative wind is going to be parallel to the flight path in the opposite direction. 
* Leading edge is where the airflow strikes before separating
* Trailing edge is where the airflow leaves the wing
* Chord line is the imaginary line between the leading and trailing edge. 
* Angle of attack is the angle between the relative wind and chord line
* Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind
* Drag is perpendicular to the lift
* Resultant force is the combination of lift and drag
* Lift is proportional to the speed of the aircraft and angle of attack of the airfoil.
* Faster speed usually means higher amounts of lift. Higher angle of attack usually means more lift. 
* Top of the airfoil has lower pressure because it makes the air go up faster
* Bottom of the airfoil has high pressure because it doesn't speed up. 
* Higher pressure area wants to get to equilibrium. So, it will head towards lower pressure area. 

### Weight
* Weight is the result of gravity and it is applied at the Center of Gravity.
* Center of gravity is the point where the aircraft is in equlibrium
* Always opposite to Lift.
* If the weight of the aircraft exceeds maximum allowable weight, the airfoil won't be able to produce enough lift to counteract the weight. 

### Thrust
* For fixed wing, the propeller produces the thrust. 
* Propeller is an airfoil itself. Same principle as lift. 
* For rotorcraft, the thrust is created by the motor and the propellers in the motor. Thrust is only created if the rotorcraft is banked. 
* If vertical lift and weight are equal and the thurst and drag are equal, then we have an unaccelerated forward flight. 
* There should be an imbalance between thrust and drag for you to accelerate forward or backward. 
* Similarly, there should be an imbalance between lift and weight for you to accelerate up or down. 
* If all the four forces are equal, then the rotorcraft will remain stationary at a point. 

### Drag
Two types of drag

* Parasitic Drag
* Induced Drag (also known as Lift Induced Drag)

#### Parasitic Drag
As the speed of the aircraft through the air increases, parasitic drag increases. 

There are three different types of parasitic drag
* Form drag - Drag induced due to the shape of an object
* Interference drag - The combination of drags created. Wing creates its own drag. Fuselage creates its own drag. But when you put them together, you create even more drag than the sum of the two. So, this is why you can view it as 1+1 = 3. 
* Skin Friction - Imperfections on the surface of the lift produces additional drag

#### Lift Induced Drag
* For fixed wing aircraft, the lift induced drag starts as soon as lift is produced. 
* For rotorcraft, the lift induced drag starts as soon as you move laterally or side ways. 
* As the speed increases, induced drag reduces. 
* But the greater the angle of attack, the greater the induced drag. 

### Stalls
* Stall occurs when the aircraft hits the critical angle of attack
* Lift is no longer generated
* Stall can happen at any air speed. 
* Airflow is no longer laminar in the case of a stall. 
* Quadcopter stalls are extremely rare. 
* Only way to reduce stall is the lower the angle of attack

### Load Factor
* Load factor is the acceleration of gravity. Commonly referred to g forces. 
* Load factor increases with the bank angle in a fixed wing aircraft because of centrifugal force. 
* Aircraft can disintegrate if the load factor is way above specifications.
* As load factor increases, the faster you are going to stall. 
* Don't do any abrupt turns when you are close to the ground.

### Stability
* The ability of an aircraft to return to the original flight path
* There are two types of stability - static stability and dynamic stability. 
* Static stability - Initial tendency to go back to equilibrium. Positive - Go back to the starting point. Neutral - Stays after disturbance. Negative - Goes in an unpredictable and irreversible direction after disturbance. 
* Dynamic stability - Response over time. Positive Static, Positive Dynamic, Positive Static, Neutral Dynamic and Positive Static and Negative Dynamic

## Factors Affecting Performance
* CG Location - Center of Gravity Location
* Altitude
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Weight

### Center of Gravity Location
* Arm - Distance between CG and force
* Moment - The efficiency of the force. It is a product of arm and force. 
* Think about a door. The hinges are usually where CG is located. The knob is where the force is usually applied and the knob is usually located on the other side of the hinge. So, the distance between the hinge and door knob is the arm. The force is the force applied on the knob. Since the arm is long, the force can be minimal. 
* When an object is shifted from one location to another, the center of gravity location is shifted. 
* Every aircraft has center of gravity limits. So, center of gravity location cannot shift unexpectedly. 
* Always ensure that the equipment loaded into the aircraft is loaded in a way that doesn't affect the CG location during the flight. 
* Aft means back
* Forward means forward

#### Aft CG
Effect of Aft CG
* Higher Crusing Speed because taildown moment doesn't need to be high
* Increased range
* Shorter takeoff distance
* Decreased Stability
* Possibly uncontrollable
* Even a slight change in angle of attack will cause rotation or take off
* Similarly a small flare will be exaggerated on landing
* Lower stall speed

All of this is only applicable for fixed wing aircraft. For quadcopters, the flight performance (range, cruise speed and others) will be affected by aft CG. 

#### Forward CG
Forward CG causes

* Slower cruise speed
* Decreased range
* Longer takeoff distance
* Increased stability
* Easier stall recovery
* Longer takeoff
* Difficult flaring
* Faster stall speed

#### Exceeding CG Limits
If you exceed CG limits, it is called running the aircraft outside its envelope. 
* Too forward CG, aircraft will never take off
* Too far aft, the aircraft will stall as soon as it is airborne

For quadcopter, shifting the CG will cause instability and wearing out one or mroe of the motors compared to others and potential failure. 

Always make sure that the weight is within limits. 

### Altitude
As altitude increases, pressure decreases. Air density decreases. So, engine performance decreases. Lift is also decreased. Sea Level should also be considered because some places like Denver are already at high altitude. 

### Temperature 
* As the temperature increases, performance decreases. 
* As the humidity increases, performance decreases
* A hot humid summer day = horrible performance
* On cold days, battery performance is affected. So, quadcopters might have reduced range on those days. 

### Weight
A heavier aircraft needs more lift. More lift is achieved at faster speeds or at higher angle of attack. But more speed leads to more induced drag which affects performance. 

### Other Facts
For fixed wing aircraft, runway length should be considered. The kind of surface should also be considered. For both fixed wing and quadcopters, level ground is ideal. Any sort of slope is not ideal. 

For fixed wing aircraft, you want to fly into the wind as it allows for more lift. 

And always avoid obstacles. 

### FAA Questions
* Questions about Pilot's Operating Handbook or UAS manual
* Angle of Attack
* When does a plane stall

As angle of attack increases, induced drag increases.
As speed increases, induced drag decreases. 
Weight doesn't change angle of attack

## Part 107 Regulations
* eCFR - Electronic Code of Federal Regulations

Important Regulations related to drones
* Part 107 - Small Unmanned Aircraft
* Part 48 - Registration of Unmanned Aircraft
* Part 89 - Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft

### Part 107
Remote Pilots operating for non-recreational purposes. Everyone has to operate under 107 unless and until you have an exemption under USC Section 44809 which is Flying As a Recreational Pilot. You can also operate under Certificate of Waiver or Authorization if you work on public safety or for government. 

CFR stands for Code of Federal Regulations. Title 14 is for air and space. Title 49 is related to Transporation and it is related to us because of NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board). Part 107 is under Title 14. 

One important note, FAA uses calendar months. On the last day of the month is what FAA means by that. 

### Part 107 Sub Part A - General
This part applies towards the registration, airman certification and operation of civil small unmanned aircraft systems in the US. 

If FAA says public in some place, they mean government and public safety. 

107 doesn't apply to the following situations
* Air carrier operations - Drone delivery is not included in 107 and instead included in Part 135. 
* Any aircraft that is subject to 49 USC 44809. 44809 is a broad exemption for purely recreational fliers and it has very strict rules. So, check those rules. 
* This also doesn't apply to cases where the pilot in command elects to conduct pursuant to exemption under Section 333 or USC 44807 or Part 91. 333 is the former regulations before 107. Part 91 only applies to aircraft over 55 pounds. It is often used for flying big planes. 

#### When do you need a Part 107 license?
Any time you are not flying recreationally. Don't get into trouble with the FAA. The fines are steep. Exchange of money is not a factor for 107. The intent of the flight is what matters. 

#### 107.3 Definitions

* Small unmanned aircraft - Less than 55 pounds on takeoff. There is no lower limit. Even the sub 250 gram drone has to be registered if you are flying under Part 107. Only flights on USC 44309 do not have register their sub 250 gram drones.

* Unmanned aircraft is defined as an aircraft operated without the possibility of direct human intervention from within or on the aircraft. 

* Remote Pilot In Command - A person who is manipulating the controls of sUAS or is supervising the person manipulating the controls. 

* Visual Observer - A person designated by the remote pilot in command to assist the remote pilot in command and the person manipulating the flight controls of the small UAS to see and avoid other air traffic or objects aloft or on the ground. 

#### 107.5 Falsification, Reproduction or Alteration
This section pretty much says don't try to falisify, reproduce or alter FAA documents. Punishment can be severe. 

A Remote Pilot In Command must have the following in his/her possession
* Remote Pilot Certificate
* A source of identification
* Any document that is required under Part 107 - Renewal written exam, registration, waivers, etc. 

Keep all registration documents for all your drones. Carry your license on a lanyard. Always keep digital copies. 

The pilot should make the documents available to
* The FAA
* Authorized representative of NTSB
* Any federal, state or local law enforcement
* Authorized representative from TSA

FAA has the right to make any test or inspection of any of the following
* the sUAS
* the remote pilot in command
* the person manipulating the flight controls
* the visual observor

107.9 talks about accidents. Any accident must be reported to the FAA within 10 calendar days. Accident is defined as the following

* Serious injury to any person or loss of consciousness
* Damage to any property where the cost of repair exceeds $500


### Part 107 Sub Part B - Operating Rules
You must either have a 
* Remote Pilot Certificate or 
* Must be under the direct supervision of a remote pilot in command who can take control of the small unmanned aircraft

You are restricted to one uAS flight at any given time. 

You can take control by
* Standing next to the non rated controller
* Using a buddy box system with two controllers
* Using an automated system where rPIC can place the aircraft into safe mode such as hover, holding pattern or return home safely. 

107.13 talks about registration. Registration of drones is required for any drones less than 55 pounds. The registration sticker must be easily readable and the FAA requires the markings to be present outside the aircraft. Drone registration date expires exactly 3 years from the day of registration. 

You cannot operate the aircraft unless and until the conditions are safe. The flight cannot be continued if the rPIC knows that is no longer a safe operation. 

107.17 talks about rPICs' medical condition. You are not allowed to be a rPIC, visual observor or manipulating the flight controls if you are not physically or mentally able to safely operate the aircraft. This also applies to anyone else that might be part of your operation. 

If you don't have the dexterity to operate, or visually impaired in some way to maintain the "see and avoid" vigilance or unable to maintain situational awareness due to illness or medications or debilitating physical condition such as a migrane or headache or hearing or speaking impairment that prevents effective communication. You might use alternate approaches to communicate effectively. 

* The remote pilot must be designated before or during the flight. 
* The remote pilot in command is responsible for and has the final authority for the operation. 
* The remote pilot in command is responsible for making sure that the aircraft won't pose undue hazard to other people, other aircraft or other property in the case of loss of control of the aircraft for any reason. 
* The remote pilot in command is responsible for making sure that all applicable regulations are complied with. 
* The remote pilot in command is responsible for making sure that the remote aircraft complies with all applicable rules and regulations. 
* It is possible for two remote pilots in command to transfer controls as long as they can maintain line of sight without loss of control. 

107.21 handles in flight emergencies. Remote pilot in command may deviate from any rule of this part to meet the needs of the emergency. If you deviate, you are required upon request by the FAA, to submit a written report on why you deviated. 

107.23 deals with hazardous operation. No person may operate an aircraft in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another or allow an object to be dropped from an aircraft that creates an undue hazard to persons or property. 

107.25 deals with operations from a moving vehicle or aircraft. No person can operate an aircraft from another moving aircraft or from a moving land or water borne vehicle unless and until the aircraft is being operated over a sparsely populated area and is not transporting another person's property for compensation or hire. This is probably to tackle paparazzis. 

107.27 talks about alcohol and drugs. This regulation pretty much says you must comply with 91.17 and 91.19. Pretty much the regulations say the following

* You cannot operate or act as a crewmember of an aircraft within 8 hours of consumption of any alcoholic beverage. 
* You cannot be under the influence of alcohol. 
* You cannot be under the influence of any drugs (legl or illegal)
* You cannot have an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater
* You must submit to an alcohol test if requested by law enforcement and must provide the test of those results with in four hours of the test
* Refusing a test will result in denial of license for a period of 1 year. 
* Suspension or revocation of your remote pilot certificate
* No person shall operate a civil aircraft if they have knowledge that narcotic drugs, marijuana or any kind of depressant or stimulation drugs or substances are carried in the aircraft. 

107.57 - Any offenses realted to drugs (including marijuana) will result in the denial of application for one year after the date of the final conviction and suspension or revocation of remote pilot certificate. Similar penalties apply for 107.27 offenses related to alcohol. 

No medical certificates are required to operate under Part 107.
